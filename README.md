<h1>Hi, I’m Marcel!</h1>

<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>My main interest is a future career in game development. However, program development is also on my interests.
I’m currently learning Unreal Engine 4 basics, as well as advanced Python GUIs. During my college, I am also learning VB.NET, however I prefer not to use it.</p>

<h3>Collaboration and work</h3>
<p>Happy to collaborate on any projects, or practice my programming skills on any free work you'd like me to create.
I'm also looking for a programming related job that would fit in my schedule.

Reach out to me on my email: marcelbarlik@gmail.com</p>

<h3>Information</h3>
<p>I do not have public repositories, but I am able to produce examples of work if requested.
